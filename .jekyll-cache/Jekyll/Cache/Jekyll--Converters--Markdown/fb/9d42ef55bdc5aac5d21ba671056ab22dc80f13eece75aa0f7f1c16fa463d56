I"5<p>An application data backup creates an archive file that contains the database, all repositories and all attachments. This archive will be saved in <strong>backup_path</strong>, which is specified in the <strong>config/gitlab.yml</strong> file. The filename will be <strong>[TIMESTAMP]_gitlab_backup.tar</strong>, where TIMESTAMP identifies the time at which each backup was created.</p>

<p>You can only restore a backup to exactly the same version of GitLab on which it was created. The best way to migrate your repositories from one server to another is through backup restore.</p>

<p>To restore a backup, you will also need to restore <strong>/etc/gitlab/gitlab-secrets.json</strong> (for omnibus packages) and <strong>/etc/gitlab/gitlab-secret.js</strong> (for installations from source). This file contains the database encryption key and CI secret variables used for two-factor authentication. If you fail to restore this encryption key file along with the application data backup, users with two-factor authentication enabled will lose access to your GitLab server.
###Create a backup of the gitlab system
Use this command if you’ve installed GitLab with the Omnibus package:</p>
<pre><code data-trim="" class="yaml">
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:backup:create
</code></pre>
<p>Use this if you’ve installed GitLab from source:</p>
<pre><code data-trim="" class="yaml">
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:backup:create RAILS_ENV=production
</code></pre>
<p>If you are running GitLab within a Docker container, you can run the backup from the host:</p>
<pre><code data-trim="" class="yaml">
docker exec -t <container name=""> gitlab-rake gitlab:backup:create
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
You can specify that portions of the application data be skipped using the environment variable SKIP. You can skip:
<pre><code data-trim="" class="yaml">
db (database)
uploads (attachments)
repositories (Git repositories data)
builds (CI build output logs)
artifacts (CI build artifacts)
lfs (LFS objects)
registry (Container Registry images)
</code></pre>
Separate multiple data types to skip using a comma. For example:
<pre><code data-trim="" class="yaml">
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:backup:create SKIP=db,uploads
</code></pre>

###Restore a previously created backup
- Restore <strong>/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb</strong> and <strong>/etc/gitlab/gitlab-secrets.json</strong>
- Note: that you need to run <strong>gitlab-ctl reconfigure</strong> after changing gitlab-secrets.json
- Restore a previously backup
<pre><code data-trim="" class="yaml">
sudo service gitlab stop

bundle exec rake gitlab:backup:restore RAILS_ENV=production
</code></pre>
Options:
<pre><code data-trim="" class="yaml">
BACKUP=timestamp_of_backup (required if more than one backup exists)
force=yes (do not ask if the authorized_keys file should get regenerated)
</code></pre>
</container></code></pre>
